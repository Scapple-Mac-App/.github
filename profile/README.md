## 📊 Overview  

Scapple is a flexible, freeform mind-mapping and idea-capturing tool created by Literature & Latte, the team behind Scrivener. Unlike traditional mind-mapping software that forces users into rigid hierarchies, Scapple gives you complete creative freedom to place notes anywhere on an open canvas. This approach makes it ideal for brainstorming, outlining, exploring ideas, and developing complex conceptual structures without constraints.

The canvas behaves like a blank sheet of paper where you can type thoughts, drag notes around, group ideas visually, and connect related items with simple lines. You’re free to organize your notes in any direction—horizontally, vertically, or scattered organically. This encourages spontaneous thinking and helps capture ideas quickly before they fade.

Scapple supports rich text, customizable note shapes, colors, borders, and alignment tools that help you visually differentiate concepts. Whether you're outlining a story, planning research, mapping character relationships, organizing tasks, or preparing a presentation, Scapple adapts to any creative or analytical process.

While the interface is intentionally minimalistic, Scapple includes productivity-enhancing features such as stacking notes, auto-straightening connections, intelligent spacing tools, and instant duplication. It also works seamlessly alongside Scrivener, allowing easy import of Scapple diagrams directly into writing projects—perfect for authors, students, and researchers who rely on structured planning.

With its emphasis on open-ended creativity, Scapple provides a refreshing alternative to rigid diagramming tools. It supports the natural flow of brainstorming and helps transform scattered ideas into coherent structures while maintaining complete flexibility.
